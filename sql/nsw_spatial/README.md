# NSW Spatial Schema(s)

This largely exists as a staging schema before being
moved to more relevant schemas. But it serves as a
schema reflecting the [department of NSW Spatial
](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au).

## Data sources

The main data source for this data is the [GIS services
available here](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/server/rest/services).
