# Schema for "NSW Land Registry Service"

## What NSW LRS department does

This department is reponsible for managing records
of properties such as:

- Their owners (I make no attempt to provide this data)
- The NSW property_id for the property
- The lot / section / plan information for the property.
- Their legal property description
    - This includes a ton of information.
