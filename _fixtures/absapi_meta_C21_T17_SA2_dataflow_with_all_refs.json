The calculation determines whether rent payments are:\n\n* less than or equal to 30% of household income\n* more than 30% of household income\n\nThe Census collects the income of each person in the household aged 15 years or over in ranges. To sum these personal income values to calculate a household income, a specific dollar amount is allocated to each person. A median dollar value for each range, derived using data from the Survey of Income and Housing, is used for this purpose.
